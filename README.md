# Virtual Try-On for E-commerce: Enhancing Customer Experience with Generative AI

This repository contains the implementation of an advanced generative AI model designed to produce high-quality product images tailored for e-commerce platforms. The main goal is to facilitate virtual try-on experiences for clothing and accessories, enhancing the online shopping journey.

## Use Cases: Virtual Try-On Solutions

### Challenge
Online shoppers frequently face uncertainties regarding the fit and look of apparel and accessories, which can deter them from making purchases. Standard product images often fall short of addressing these concerns.

### Solution
Develop a virtual try-on feature powered by generative AI, enabling customers to visualize how products will look on them in real-time. This solution aims to:

- Boost conversion rates by offering a more personalized and engaging shopping experience.
- Decrease return rates by allowing customers to make better-informed purchasing decisions.
